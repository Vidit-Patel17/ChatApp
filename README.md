# ChatApp

This is a C-based group chat application that makes use of sockets and multithreading. To handle multiple clients and broadcast messages from one client to the others, the server is multithreaded. The client also has two threads: one for receiving broadcast messages (messages from other clients), and the other for receiving user input and sending it to the server.

# Issues

- UI issues on client side , while receving a broadcast message.

# Requirements

- Unix OS and gcc to compile the code.

# Compile and Running

- use the make file to compile
- This generates 2 executables - s (for server) and c (for client)
- Run server file before client and provide necessary arguements
